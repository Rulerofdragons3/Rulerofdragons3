✨ Hiiiii, I’m @Rulerofdragons3!
✨ I'm an 18 year old College student and I may be addicted to this coding thing.

✨ I currently work with Python, Lua, and C++.
✨ However, I have also worked with Java, Javascript (p5js), C#, and Ruby.

✨ My socials all go under the name "Rulerofdragons3"; If you find an account with that name, It's probably me.

✨ Also, Hi mom! I'm on GitHub now!
<!---
Rulerofdragons3/Rulerofdragons3 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
